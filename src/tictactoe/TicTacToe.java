    // Game Logic --> How do we win; how do we lose
    // VIA gameOver method that checks things
    
    // Controls --> How do we play? How do we enter X's and O's
    // VIA terminal/entering in the console
    
    // Monte Carlo AI -> How does the AI know what to do next?
    // VIA probabilities + monte carlo method of running many and many 
    // scenarios, observing the results, and then choosing where to go
    
    // What classes will we need?
    // - A class managing the AI components -> how we run all the 
    //   simulations, observe results, etc. (USING Heuristics & Probabilities)
    // - A class that contains the logic of the game 
    //   (onTick/update, react, display)
    // - A custom class (or some type of data structure) that stores the current
    //   state of the game
