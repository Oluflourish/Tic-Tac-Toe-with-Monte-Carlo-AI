# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Monte-Carlo-AI
This program uses Monte Carlo simulations as an AI for Tic Tac Toe. What exactly does that mean? It means that the AI uses the monte carlo method to probabilistically determine its best move. Without knowing any rules of the game, the AI runs through thousands of simulations each turn and using the results, picks the 'best/most likely to win' approach.
