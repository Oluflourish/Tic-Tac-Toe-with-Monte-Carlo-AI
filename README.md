# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Monte-Carlo-AI
This program uses Monte Carlo simulations as an AI for Tic Tac Toe. What exactly does that mean? It means that the AI uses the monte carlo method to probabilistically determine its best move. Without knowing any rules of the game, the AI runs through thousands of simulations of possible games each turn and after viewing the results, chooses the 'best/most likely to win' spot. This AI doesn't really care about making it so the user loses, but it wants to win. Therefore, it will pick the spot where it is most likely to win versus the 'make the user lose and create a draw' or 'stop the user from winning the round' spot.
